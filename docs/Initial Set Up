Set Up:
To begin we start with the creation of the tables inside of MySQL. 
The first thing I usually do is "DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS (YourProjectHere)". 
This means it will create a new schema to run every time you execute the script. 
I then do "CREATE SCHEMA (YourProjectHere)" to create a new schema to store the tables in. 
Then you do "USE (YourProjectHere)" to make sure the next few queries actually put the created tables into the correct schema. 

Table to Make:
The four tables we should make are the "patron_types" table, "libraries" table, "notification_modes" table, and the "patron_profiles" tables. 

"patron_types" Table:
The "patron_types" table will have two coloumns, "patron_type_code" will be an integer and "patron_type_def" will be a varchar. "patron_type_code" will be a primary key.

"libraries" Table:
The "libraries" table will have two coloumns, "library_code" which will be a varchar and "library_name" which will also be a varchar. "library_code" will be a will be a primary key.

"notification_modes" Table:
The "notification_modes" table will have two coloumns, "notification_code" which will be a varchar and "notification_desc" which will also be a varchar. "notification_code" will be a primary key as well.

"patron_profiles" Table: 
The final table will be "patron_profiles". This table will have eight coloumns with three foreign keys. The first coloumn will be "profile_id" which will be an integer that auto increments. 
The second will be "age_range" and it is a varchar. The third is "total_checkouts" and an integer. The fourth is "total_renewals" and it is an integer. The fifth is "year_registered" and it will be an integer. 
The sixth will be "sf_resident" and it will be a boolean. The seventh will be "has_email" and it will be a boolean. And the eighth will be "last_active" and it will be a date. 
The three foreign keys that will be linked to this table are "patron_type_code" from "patron types", "home_library_code" from "libraries", and "notification_code" from "notification_modes".

With that you should have the entire inital framework in place, next we need to move the data from "SFPL_DataSF_library-usage_Jan_2023.xlsx" into our desired tables.
